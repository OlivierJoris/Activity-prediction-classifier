1. The dataset is imbalanced (e.g. 350 measures concerning subject with id 1 
and 919 for id 5) : 

(a) Random oversampling and undersampling :https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-oversampling-and-undersampling-for-imbalanced-classification/
(b) SMOTE : https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/
(c) ADASYN : https://towardsdatascience.com/adasyn-adaptive-synthetic-sampling-method-for-imbalanced-data-602a3673ba16

2. There are 512 * 3500 measures which can be summarize without losing a lot of 
information using features selection :

(a) Variance threshold : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.VarianceThreshold.html
Goal : Eliminates low-variance features

(b) Recursive feature elimination : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html
Goal : Recursively remove feature with cross-validation
