for that :

Variance threshold : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.VarianceThreshold.html
Goal : Eliminates low-variance features

Recursive feature elimination : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html
Goal : Recursively remove feature with cross-validation
